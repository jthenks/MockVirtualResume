# MockVirtualResume

https://jthenksmockresume.herokuapp.com/

This is a webpage that goes over some of my basic (outdated) resume information. It includes education, skills, work experience, and a bit of information about my past experience as a speed skater. 

This virtual resume was originally a university assignment. I have not updated it to include any of my programming projects or experience. 

The main purpose of this project was to demonstrate media use and responsive layouts.
